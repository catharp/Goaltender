There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

    Goaltender tracks your goals for you and reminds you to regularly put in the effort toward achieve those goals.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

    Whether you need help following through on your ambitions or just want to outsource some of the discipline involved in tracking your many aspirations, Goaltender is for you.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

    Goaltender allows you to track goals from all aspects of your life in one simple, easy to use interface and encourages you to make gradual progress toward achieving each of them.  Just add your goal and set up a basic timeline for it.  Goaltender will help you track your progress and remind you to revisit it along the way.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

    We all have goals.  For some of us they are the drive that gets us out of bed every morning.  For others they may seem like distant dreams, but no matter how grand, the possibilities are limitless if you dedicate yourself and make a commitment to regular progress.  Many themselves chasing several different goals simultaneously between work, family, and social lives.  At the end of the day it can be tough to keep track of them all, and at the end of the year it can be frustrating to look back and find some of those goals left undone.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

    Goaltender helps you prioritize your efforts by organizing all your goals in one place and helps hold you accountable along the road to achieving them by reminding you to make regular, quantifiable progress.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

    "Dreaming big is the easy part.  It's having the discipline and persistence necessary to make those dreams reality that truly drives greatness."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

    Just log in and create your first goal by forming a rough timeline of accomplishments to outline your path and then let Goaltender keep things in perspective for you along the way by logging your achievements and reminding you of individual goals that you may have neglected.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

    "As a modern parent of two I feel constantly occupied by work and family life and often feel like I barely have any energy left for personal development, but Goaltender helps me keep a bird's eye view on my busy life and even find a little time for me in between."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

    Don't let another month slip by stuck in the same old routine.  Get started building the world of your dreams.  Tend to your goals!
